# ChatGPT Cloner

Clone and continue your ChatGPT conversations seamlessly.

**ChatGPT Cloner** is a browser extension that adds a "Clone" button to your ChatGPT interface. It allows you to extract an entire conversation (keeping the full context) and automatically start a new chat with it, bypassing length limits or "stuck" contexts.

## Features

- **One-Click Cloning:** A simple button integrated directly into the ChatGPT header.
- **Full Context Retention:** Extracts the entire conversation history, including user prompts and AI responses.
- **Auto-Continue:** Automatically starts a new chat, attaches the history as a context file, and primes the AI to continue exactly where you left off.
- **Smart Extraction:** Intelligently handles scrolling to capture long conversations that are virtualized by the interface.
